For storing the data in the context of the predictive career mapping system utilizing Big Data analytics, it is crucial to choose a storage solution that can handle large volumes of diverse data types efficiently, provide scalability, and ensure data security and accessibility. Here are some storage options that could be considered:

1. Distributed File Systems (e.g., Hadoop HDFS): Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is well-suited for storing and managing large volumes of data. It offers distributed storage and fault tolerance, making it a good choice for handling diverse datasets in Big Data analytics. HDFS can accommodate both structured and unstructured data efficiently.

2. NoSQL Databases: NoSQL databases like Apache Cassandra, MongoDB, or Couchbase are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data. They are highly scalable and can accommodate the dynamic nature of data in this context.

3. Data Warehouses: Traditional data warehousing solutions like Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Snowflake can be used to store structured data efficiently. These platforms offer powerful querying and data analysis capabilities.

4. Cloud Storage: Cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage can be used for storing data, especially if you need to leverage cloud-based resources and scalability. They are cost-effective and provide accessibility from anywhere.

5. Graph Databases: If the data involves complex relationships, a graph database like Neo4j could be a valuable addition. It can be used to represent career networks, connections, and recommendations.

6. Data Lakes: Data lakes like AWS Lake Formation or Azure Data Lake Storage are suitable for storing a wide variety of data types in their raw form. They can integrate with Big Data processing frameworks like Apache Spark or Hadoop.

7. Hybrid Solutions: A combination of different storage solutions might be ideal. For instance, you could use HDFS for raw data storage, NoSQL databases for unstructured data, and a data warehouse for structured data, creating a hybrid storage architecture.

The choice of storage solution should align with the specific needs of the project, the nature of the data being collected, the processing tools used (e.g., Spark, Hadoop), and budget constraints. It's also important to consider data security, backup, and disaster recovery measures, especially when handling sensitive career-related data.
